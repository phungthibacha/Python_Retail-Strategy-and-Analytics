# Retail Strategy Optimization: A Data-Driven Journey for Chip Retail Management
Welcome to the code behind the chips! This repository houses the analytics and visualizations used to optimize the chip category for a major grocery retailer. Buckle up for a data-driven adventure filled with customer segmentation, statistical insights, and snack-sized recommendations.

## Project Objective:

To understand chip purchasing behavior, identify key customer segments, and provide actionable recommendations for boosting chip sales while keeping snackers happy.

## Data Analysis Flow:

- Data Wrangling: Cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring transaction and customer data to unlock its hidden potential.
- Customer Segmentation: Identify top performance customer segments based on purchase behavior and preferences. 
- Control Store Selection: Employing correlation analysis and magnitude distance to find the perfect control stores for testing the impact of new chip layouts, ensuring fair and statistically sound comparisons.
- Impact Assessment: Comparing sales and customer data of trial and control stores to measure the effectiveness of the new layout. Did the chips fly off the shelves or flop?
- Visualization: Translating complex data into engaging charts and graphs to tell the story of customer behavior and layout impact.
- Actionable Insights: Delivering recommendations tailored to specific customer segments and backed by data-driven evidence. 

## Technical Stack:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
